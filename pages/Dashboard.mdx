| NIST 800-53 | NIST SP 800-53 provides a list of controls that support the development of secure and resilient federal information systems. These controls are the operational, technical, and management standards and guidelines used by information systems to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability |
| NIST CSF | NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a set of guidelines for mitigating organizational cybersecurity risks, published by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) based on existing standards, guidelines, and practices. It provides a "taxonomy of cybersecurity outcomes and a methodology to assess and manage those outcomes", in addition to guidance on the protection of privacy and civil liberties in a cybersecurity context |
| HIPAA | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a federal law that required the creation of national standards to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without the patient's consent or knowledge |

| Canada Protected B Medium Integrity Medium Availability (PBMM) | PBMM controls identify the baseline security controls that must be implemented by CSPs and GC departments and agencies in order to appropriately protect cloud-based GC services and related information having a security category of Protected B, medium integrity, and medium availability (PBMM) |
| Reserve Bank India (RBI) Cyber Security Framework | A comprehensive cyber security framework by RBI for Urban Cooperative Banks, as a graded approach, based on their digital depth and interconnectedness with the payment systems landscape, digital products offered by them, and assessment of cyber security risk |
