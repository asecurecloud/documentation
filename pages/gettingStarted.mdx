# Getting Started with ASecureCloud

Sign in to your ASecureCloud account or Sign up for a free trial.

Once signed in, you can:

- add an [AWS account](#add-an-aws-account)

You can also find instructions to add an [AWS Organization](gettingStarted/awsOrganizations) or an [Azure Management Group](gettingStarted/azureManagementGroups).

## Add an AWS account

Once logged in, click on the "New AWS Account" button.

You can also go to Settings -> Cloud Settings -> New AWS Account

### Add your AWS account details

### Create the authentication profile

Here you select permissions for the ASecureCloud to access your AWS account.

### Finalize the profile setup
