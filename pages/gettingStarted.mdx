# Getting Started with ASecureCloud

Sign in to your ASecureCloud account or Sign up for a free trial.

Once signed in, you can :

- add an [AWS account](#add-an-aws-account)
- add an [Azure subscription](#add-an-azure-subscription)

You can also find instructions to add an [AWS Organization](gettingStarted/awsOrganizations) or an [Azure Management Group](gettingStarted/azureManagementGroups).

## Add an AWS account

Click on the "New AWS Account" button. You can also go to Settings -> Cloud Settings -> New AWS Account

### Add your AWSccount details
Here you need to provide:

- AWS Account ID
- AWS Account Name / Description
- Workload region (where the workload is deployed, e.g. us-east-1)
- Account Type (Production, Dev, Sandbox)   `used for rule severity weighting`
- Scheduled Assessments toggle on/off (default is on)

Once done, click on the "Add Account and Create Profile" button.


### Create the authentication profile

Here you select permissions for the ASecureCloud to access your AWS account.

- Read-only access (default)
- Read/Write access to the well-Architected tool (if you want to write back to the Well-Architected tool)

Note : You can select read-only or none if you do not use the well-Architected tool.

Once done, click on the "Continue Profile Setup" button.
  

### Finalize the profile setup

Select the IAM Role Name that will be used to access your AWS account.

The system will generate a template for you in both 
- cloudformation
- terraform

You can deploy this template directly to your AWS account (recommended) or download it for a manual deployment.

Once done, click on the "Validate" button.

### Validate the profile

if the profile is valid, you will see a green checkmark.

You can now click on the "Create Profile and Launch Assessment" button.
